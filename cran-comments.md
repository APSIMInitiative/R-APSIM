1 NOTES:

* No repository set, so cyclic dependency check skipped. Despite my best efforts, and attempting all solutions provided by http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27046546/note-in-r-cran-check-no-repository-set-so-cyclic-dependency-check-skipped, I cannot get rid of this note. It appears to be related to the local machine so I'm continuing with the submission.
